# 📄 Documentation & Reference Models

This `/docs` folder contains **Product Requirements Documents (PRD)**, **data model definitions**, and **Firebase schema references** for the Karaoke App project.

These files are intended for:
- 📃 Developers reviewing the business logic and architecture.
- 🤖 AI tools like Cursor or Copilot that reference documentation for context-aware coding.
- 📝 Project planning, architecture decisions, and future enhancements.
- 🚀 **Building the app from scratch with any framework/platform combination.**

- **Guide for architecture decisions** and technology choices
- **Source of truth** for all functional requirements
- **Migration guide** when switching frameworks/platforms

### **For New Implementations:**
1. **Read the PRD completely** - it contains comprehensive specifications
2. **Review design assets** in `platforms/web/design/` folder for visual reference
3. **Answer implementation questions** from Section 29
4. **Follow the implementation checklist** for complete build process
5. **Preserve business logic** while adapting UI to chosen framework

## 🔄 Workflow for New Versions

### **When Creating New Implementations:**
1. **Use the PRD as-is** - it's designed for any framework/platform
2. **Reference design assets** for visual guidance and UX patterns
3. **Follow the implementation guide** in Section 29
4. **Preserve all business logic** while adapting UI layer
5. **Test against specifications** for 100% accuracy

### **When Updating the PRD:**
1. **Keep platform-agnostic requirements** intact
2. **Add new implementation details** to appropriate sections
3. **Update toolset sections** with new technology choices
4. **Maintain self-guiding nature** for AI implementation

### **When Migrating Platforms:**
1. **Keep all business logic** from core requirements
2. **Replace only implementation details** in platform-specific sections
3. **Add new platform sections** following the established pattern
4. **Update toolset rationale** for new technology choices

## Important Notes
- ✅ These files are **not intended for direct import or use in application runtime**.
- ✅ Validation logic and data models here serve as **development references only**.
- ✅ Any updates to business logic, data flow, or app architecture should be reflected here for documentation purposes.
- ✅ AI tools may use this information to assist with code generation but will not access `/src` directly.
- ✅ **The PRD is self-guiding** - it contains all instructions needed for AI implementation.
- ✅ **100% accuracy achievable** when following the complete specifications.
